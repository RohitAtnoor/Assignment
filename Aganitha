This is the Thesis presentaion video by Mr.Somesh Mohapatra. He has created a Machine Learing Model on the Macromolecules.
He has explained about the macromolecules and how they are distingushed. The representaion of the molecules provide limited coverage of 
chemical space and topologies.
The Similar composition of the molecules is limited to biological macromolecules. and there are many varients of the macromolecules.
In the field of Polymers the Machine learning is restricted dy descriptors.

The methods followed by them was to collect the fingerprint and read the molecular patern from the data.
Creating a Differential Group, creating the fingerprint marix.and this was calculated by the similarity matrix to identify the
non linear pattern.

This application can be used in Medical field in the study of cancer vaccines, automated flow synthesis
and this application has a vast uses in this field.
With this we can study the pattern for the cancer and genetic disorder.

They have used Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Lasso, Logistic and other 15 models to build the model. 
The model was trained with neural network and genetic algrothem to math the molecular pattern.
They have predicted the model with the help of CNN and they have a high accuracy for this model.
This model was successfuly validated 2 cleavable comonomers discovered by virtual screening.
